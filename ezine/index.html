                       this is your average computer enthusiast who misses the old community.
                       i miss the old tinkering meaning that the word 'hacking' had once upon a time.
                
                       i am not by any means the best computer guru, neither great with words.
                       
                
                       < Anon > : So wtf are you doing writing a magazine?
                
                       my intentions with these sporadic issues is nothing more than documenting my
                       path along these 0's and 1's in the way that i would like to read from others.               
                
                
                       i consider myself very creative and this is translated in having a lot of
                       projects. projects that will be shown in here.
                
                       
                       i don't want to make this much longer, so follow me if you are interested
