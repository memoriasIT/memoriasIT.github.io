    <p><b>Machine learning </b> has got a lot of popularity in our modern world due to the development
    of the internet, the storage of large amounts of data, etc. Most of
    the nowadays technologies are more or less related to the automation
    of learning, some examples could be <b>spam detection</b>, <b>speech recognition</b>,
    <b>image classifying</b>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Machine learning itself is a subfield of computer science which allows computers to
    learn by themselves. The term was first <b> coined in 1959</b> by IBM, however it never
    gained as much popularity as it has today.</p>
    
    <p>Machine learning has probably earned that much popularity due to the
    fact that <b>more data was created in the last 2 years than in the whole
        history</b>, and also, that as we can see in top500.org the computers are
    exponentially getting better which allows us to execute more complex
    operations faster.</p>
    
    <p>It is strictly <b>related</b>  to several fields such as <b> data analysis, data mining and maths</b>. In order
    to fully understand machine learning, a basis of algebra and statistics
    is needed.<br>
    
    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TV9nQwF.png" alt="diagram01" /></p>
    
    <p>In machine learning we can classify the tasks into <b>three categories,</b> 
    we will see examples of each of them.</p>
    
    <p><b>Supervised learning:</b>  we provide some example inputs (called training data)
    and the desired outputs. The model has to make predictions while being
    trained and corrected if they are wrong. The training process will end
    whenever the desired level of accuracy is achieved. <br>
    Some examples are Decision Trees and Logistic Regressions. Find more info
    about them here:
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/">Tree Based Modeling from Scratch in Python</a><br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">Wikipedia: logistic regression</a>

    
    <p><br><b>Unsupervised learning:</b>  we canât make predictions as we donât know the 
    result. We can get the model by deducing structures found in the input data 
    where some general rules could be found. Some examples are K-means and 
    the Apriori algorithm. Find more info here: 
    </p>
    <a href="https://en.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/93VPG/k-means-algorithm">Coursera: K-Means Algorithm</a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm">Wikipedia: Apriori Algorithm</a>

    
    <p><br><b>Semi-supervised learning:</b>  as you can imagine itâs just the combination 
    of supervised and unsupervised learning, you have a desired problem but
     the model has to learn the structures as well as making predictions. Some
     examples are classification and regression.
    </p>

    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HKtMPm5.png" alt="tQuwb4G.png" /></p>
    
    <p>An <b>algorithm</b> is a sequence of actions that will be performed in order.
     They can be used for calculation, data processing and automated 
    reasoning.
    For you to understand you can think of a <b>recipe</b>, you have several steps 
    that you have to complete in order.</p>
    
    <p>When we get here things start to get a bit harder and if you want to 
    fully understand how everything works you will need to know algebra 
    and statistics, however, if you just want to have a general knowledge 
    and understand the basics you will be fine with this tut.</p>
    
    <p><b> Algorithms can be divided by the learning style or the similarity in 
    form/function.</b> Here we will categorize them by similarity (how they 
    work). I also have to say that this is a bit off sometimes as some 
    algorithms can be found in different categories depending on your source.</p>
    
    <p>First of all I would like to show you a cheat sheet with the most 
    important algorithms that we will see:
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/v6zzgnT.png" alt="v6zzgnT.png" />
    <small>Source: https://machinelearningmastery.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p>Starting from the top we see the <b>Deep Learning Algorithms, </b> 
    they are used to create <b>complex neural networks,</b>  most of the methods 
    are <b>semi-supervised, large datasets</b> are provided. <br>
    Some important algorithms are the <b>Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM),
     the Deep Belief Networks (DBM), the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</b>  
    and Stacked Auto-encoders.
    It is used a lot for computer vision and speech recognition, they excell
    in image, audio and text data. However, as they need a lot of data it is 
    not suitable for every possible scenario, they also require a lot of 
    computer resources.
    This is one of my favourites so you will probably see some tutorials in 
    the future if I manage to fight my laziness xD</p>
    
    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Trhb5Aq.png" alt="Trhb5Aq.png" />
        <small>Source: https://catalystsecure.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p>Neural networks are inspired by the structure of biological neural 
    networks, they are usually used for regression and classification problems 
    but they can be used in a million case scenarios. Neural networks and Deep 
    Learning are usually mixed up, if you want to take it easy you can imagine 
    that Deep Neural Networks are a more âcomplexâ Neural Network, they 
    have more layers and it is more efficient than the âold-schoolâ Neural Networks.
    Some important algorithms are Perceptron, Back-Propagation, The 
    Hopfield Network and the Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN).</p>
    
    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lBg3qko.png" alt="lBg3qko.png" />
        <small>Source: aircto.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p>The next one that we find is <b>Ensemble Methods</b>  (also known as 
    Classification Trees), classifiers are constructed and then new data 
    points are classified by taking a <b>weighted vote</b>  of their predictions. 
    Itâs like creating weaker models which are independently trained and 
    then combined together to make the final prediction.
    They perform well in practice, they are scalable and robust, they are 
    unlikely to overfit too (be trained too much). Some big algorithms are
    <b>Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT)</b> .</p>
    
    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CdQMDvQ.png" alt="CdQMDvQ.png" />
        <small>Source: http://magizbox.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p>In <b>Regression Algorithms</b>  a relationship between variables is
    created and refined by measuring the error produced in the predictions 
    of the model. Some important ones are <b>Linear regression and Logistic 
    Regression.</b>  You can find some examples of these types of regression here: </p>
    <a href="http://magizbox.com/training/machinelearning/site/model_regression/">Model Regression</a>
    
    
    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TIcU6nM.png" alt="TIcU6nM.png" />
        <small>Source: http://magizbox.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Regularization</b>  is just an extension to the regression methods, the only
     difference is that it penalizes the models based on their complexity 
    favoring simpler models. They are better at generalizing. They are
    popular, powerful and simple. Some examples are <b>Ridge Regression, 
    Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Elastic Net 
    and Least-Angle Regression (LARS).</b> </p>
    
    <p><b>Clustering</b> , like regression, describes the class of problem and class of methods.
    A set of objects is grouped in groups called clusters. Some examples are <b>k-Means,
    k-Medians, Expectation Maximisation (EM) and Hierarchical Clustering.</b> 
    Here you can see an example of clustering with K-means: 
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4MNW1BH.png" alt="4MNW1BH.png" />
        <small>Source: http://www.kdnuggets.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p><b> Dimensionally Reduction,</b> like clustering methods, seeks and exploits
     the inherent structure in the data, however, this time it is unsupervised or 
    the data is described with less information. It is useful for visualizing data 
    or simplifying it (which can be later used in a supervised learning method). 
    Some examples are Principal component analysis (PCA), Kernel PCA,
     Graph-based kernel PCA, Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Generalized 
    discriminant analysis (GDA).

    <small>Source: http://www.bogotobogo.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Association Rule Learning Algorithms</b>  are kind of self-explanatory, 
    they extract rules that best explain the relationship between variables in data. 
    These rules can discover important associations that can be exploited. There are 
    two very important algorithms in this category: The Apriori Algorithm and the Eclat 
    Algorithm.</p>
    
    <p><b>Bayesian Algorithms:</b>  they use the Bayesâ Theorem, it describes the probability
     of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. Some 
    examples are Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, 
    Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) and 
    Bayesian Network (BN).</p>
    
    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ojyQZKp.png" alt="ojyQZKp.png" />
        <small>Source: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com</small>
    </p>
    
    <p>In <b>Decision Tree Algorithms</b>  the model is constructed by the decisions 
    taken which are based on the values of attributes in the data. The model 
    resembles a tree and includes all possible outcomes, consequences, resource 
    costs and utility.</p>
    
    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/omoPfYh.png" alt="muAM0uE.png" />
        <small>Source: http://www.kdnuggets.com/</small>
    </p>
    
    <p>Finally we find <b>Instance Based Algorithms</b> ; this learning model is a 
    decision problem with instances or examples of training data that are deemed 
    important or required to the model. They usually build up databases of example 
    data and then they are compared to new data using a similarity measure with 
    the aim of creating the best match and in conclusion the best prediction. They 
    are also called memory-based methods and winner-take-all methods. Some 
    examples are k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), 
    Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Locally Weighted Learning (LWL).</p>
    
    <p>In a future tutorial I will tell you a methodology for choosing the best algorithm 
    for your problem, for now I would be happy if you understood everything.</p>
    
    <p>Here you can download a pdf with most of the algorithms, it is pretty useful as
     it tells you the code in python and in R (however I know you guys and Iâm sure 
    you will go straight for the python code hehe :P ). Note that it doesnât use Tensorflow.</p>

    <p>Last of all, I would like to introduce you to some tools/frameworks. I have to say
    that machine learning is a field which is experiencing a lot of big changes lately, 
    so please if you are reading this in the future bare with me and make a quick google 
    search to make sure this is still valid.</p>
    
    <p>The best of all is that there are many open source software so you donât have to 
    worry about payments. In my opinion the best tool at the moment is Tensorflow,
    however, here you can find more options for you to choose.</p>
    
    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YPxOIVr.png" alt="YPxOIVr.png" />
    <b>Tensorflow</b>  was developed by Google with its initial release in 2015. It is a very 
    powerful tool which has compatibility with most CPUs and GPUs. It supports
    python and C++.
    It is gaining a lot of popularity and the community is getting bigger and bigger everyday.
    You can easilly install it here: </p>

    <b>Scikit-learn</b> , another big framework doesnât support GPUs and is not really suitable 
    for neural networks (also want to note that most of their features were implemented 
    into Tensorflow  ;) ). It is free and also works with python, you can get more info and 
    installation instructions in their website:</p>

    <h2 class="referencelists">Caffe</h2>
    <p><br><b>Caffe</b>     is a big machine learning framework too, itâs written in c++ with a python interface.
     It is better suited for building applications (instead of Tensorflow which is developed for
     research and development). Itâs not bad at all but I feel like Tensorflow is easier to use. This 
    is their homepage:</p>

    <b>Theano</b>  is one of the first frameworks created (it was created in 2007), it follows the 
    Tensorflow style, it does not support multi-GPU nor horizontal capabilities. It uses NumPy 
    to express computations. It is considered a low-end machine learnign frameworks but in 
    reality itâs is fast and flexible. Due to being old the docs are very well explained.
    Check it out here:</p>

    <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xiaZq9p.png" alt="xiaZq9p.png" />
    <b>Keras</b>  is object oriented and simple, it uses python and can be used with theano for best 
    performance (can be used with Tensorflow too but it doesnât work that good).
    You can see a comparison of a sample of code of Keras with Tensorflow here: <br>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/ricgu8086/0ba44ce3aab19ec50425383a4d778b50"> Keras vs Tensroflow</a>
    <br>
    For simple building get Keras, if you want more tweaks go to Tensorflow.

    <b>Torch</b>  is very famous too, however, it uses Lua, if you are into that go for it (it just 
    isnât my case lol). It was used in facebook before they migrated to Tensorflow (if you 
    know what I mean).
    This is their website: </p>

    <p><br> As you can see Tensorflow is the leading software now, it is one of the most powerful
     ones and not hard to master when you get the hang of it. Another big software is Keras, 
    if you just want to play around with deep learning itâs probably your option.</p>
    
    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eWy9QyO.png" alt="3ipRh6w.png" /></p>
    
    <p>Obviously this is just some theory; I plan on making more tutorials about machine 
    learning with real examples. However, if you are impatient I will leave you some good 
    links ;)</p>
    
    <p>First of all we can find a defcon 25 talk where they apply machine learning for hacking, 
    itâs pretty interesting, in the talk they donât explain anything about coding our model but 
    it will help you imagine how machine learning works better.
    </p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbRx18VZlYA">DEF CON 25 (2017) - Weaponizing Machine Learning - Petro, Morris</a>
    
    <p><br>I found out that a book that I am reading is free online, itâs not bad and itâs suitable 
    for university students. The online version is not exactly the same as the paper one, 
    but it is very useful.</p>
    <a href="http://neuron.eng.wayne.edu/synapse2/tpage3.html">Fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks
        by Mohamad H. Hassoun</a> 
    
    
    <p><br>One of the most famous youtube channels about machine learning is Siraj Raval, he 
    studied computer science and works with python and TensorFlow, itâs a must-watch.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A">Siraj Raval Youtube Channel</a>
    
    <p><br>Sentdex is also a famous youtuber who makes coding videos, he also works with python,
     he has a very interesting project in my opinion: he made a car which drives itself in gta v 
    with machine learning (and heâs planning on adding even more AI to GTA so stay tunned guys haha).
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex">Sentdex Youtube Channel</a>
    
    <p><br>This is one of my favourites youtubers, Carykh is a bit underrated and he should have way
     more subscribers in my opinion. Check him out and give it a follow, his videos are very 
    interesting and very well made :)
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh">Carykh Youtube Channel</a>
    
    <p><br>There are way more videos and youtubers online but I think that with these links you can
    already have some fun!
    Hope you liked the tutorial and have fun :)</p>
